# 🎥 Object Tracking Application

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** for real-time object tracking in videos. The app uses **OpenCV** for video processing and object detection, allowing users to upload a video file and visualize tracked objects with bounding boxes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload Video Files**: Supports `.mp4`, `.avi`, and `.mov` formats.
- **Real-Time Object Tracking**: Detects and tracks moving objects in the video using OpenCV's background subtraction.
- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Minimum contour area for object detection.
  - Frame rate adjustment for smoother playback.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and user-friendly interface.
